# Approach 2: Projected GANs

## Status: Planned (Deferred)

This document outlines the planned investigation of Projected GANs for generating synthetic CARS microscopy images of thyroid tissue. This approach is considered a promising alternative due to its potential for high data efficiency by leveraging pre-trained feature extractors.

(More details will be added regarding:
- Core Concept of Projected GANs
- Relevance to CARS Image Synthesis (Small Dataset, Detail)
- Potential Pre-trained Backbones (ViT, CNNs, CLIP)
- Pros and Cons in the Context of this Project
- Key Papers and Reference Implementations
- High-Level Implementation Strategy for CARS Data
- Anticipated Challenges
- Potential Evaluation Metrics)
