# Approach 3: Consistency Models

## Status: Planned (Deferred)

This document outlines the planned investigation of Consistency Models for generating synthetic CARS microscopy images of thyroid tissue. This approach is considered due to its state-of-the-art generation quality and extremely fast sampling capabilities.

(More details will be added regarding:
- Core Concept of Consistency Models (Training from scratch vs. Distillation)
- Relevance to CARS Image Synthesis (High Quality, Fast Sampling, Novelty)
- Pros and Cons in the Context of this Project (especially for small datasets)
- Key Papers and Reference Implementations
- High-Level Implementation Strategy for CARS Data (from scratch)
- Anticipated Challenges (Training stability, data efficiency)
- Potential Evaluation Metrics)
